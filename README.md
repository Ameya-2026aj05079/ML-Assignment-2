# Online Shopper Purchase Intention — ML Assignment 2

## Problem statement
Build and compare five supervised classification models that predict whether an online shopping session ends in a purchase (`Revenue=True`). This is a binary classification problem. The work includes exploratory analysis, leakage-aware preprocessing, model evaluation, and a Streamlit application that evaluates saved models on an uploaded labelled test CSV without retraining.

## Dataset description
- **Dataset:** Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dataset 468)
- **Official page:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F88Q
- **Size:** 12,330 sessions; 17 original input attributes and one target attribute (`Revenue`).
- **Target:** `Revenue` (0 = no purchase, 1 = purchase).
- **Class balance:** UCI reports 10,422 non-purchase sessions (84.5%) and 1,908 purchase sessions (15.5%).
- **Feature handling:** `PageValues` is excluded from the model inputs as a leakage-aware modelling decision because it is a conversion-related analytics measure. The remaining input variables are preprocessed in a scikit-learn pipeline.

## Models used and evaluation metrics
The notebook generates `model_metrics.csv` and writes the measured values below into this README after execution. All models use the same stratified holdout test split. Precision, Recall and F1 refer to the positive class (`Revenue=1`). AUC is ROC-AUC calculated from predicted probabilities or decision scores.

| ML Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.6310 | 0.7352 | 0.2600 | 0.7487 | 0.3860 | 0.2607 |
| Support Vector Machine | 0.6476 | 0.7360 | 0.2596 | 0.6885 | 0.3771 | 0.2417 |
| Decision Tree | 0.6715 | 0.6999 | 0.2643 | 0.6283 | 0.3721 | 0.2309 |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 0.2709 | 0.6774 | 0.1719 | 0.9712 | 0.2921 | 0.1245 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0.8382 | 0.7037 | 0.3836 | 0.0733 | 0.1231 | 0.1104 |

### Observations on model performance
1. **Logistic Regression:** Achieved the highest F1-score of 0.3860 and MCC of 0.2607, indicating the best balance between precision and recall among all five models.

2. **Decision Tree:** Achieved an accuracy of 67.15% and an F1-score of 0.3721. It showed moderate performance across the evaluation metrics.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Achieved the highest accuracy of 83.82%, but its recall was only 0.0733. This indicates that it failed to identify most actual purchasing sessions.

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Achieved the highest recall of 0.9712, but its precision was only 0.1719, resulting in a large number of false-positive predictions.

5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Achieved the highest ROC-AUC of 0.7360, showing good classification ability. However, its F1-score of 0.3771 was slightly lower than Logistic Regression.

Because the target is imbalanced, accuracy is interpreted together with ROC-AUC, Recall, F1 and MCC. A model that predicts every session as non-purchase can obtain about 84.5% accuracy while failing to identify purchases.

### Overall winner
**Logistic Regression** was selected using positive-class F1 as the primary ranking metric and ROC-AUC as a secondary indicator. Its F1 was 0.3860 and ROC-AUC was 0.7352 on this holdout split.
